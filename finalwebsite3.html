				<h2 class="title"> What To Do: </h2>
					<div id="page3content">
					<h3 class="header2"> Tip 1: Stick To A Schedule </h3>
					<p class="paragraph"> Start off the year by creating a schedule/timetable, and sticking to it. Being organized in such a way will help you keep track of what assignments are due, and what you should prioritize. </p>
					</div>

					<div id="page3content5">
					<h3 class="header2"> Tip 2: Make Friends </h3>
					<p class="paragraph"> You need a support unit to get through college. Seriously. This time is rough. It also helps with having fun and creating new memories. It's also a good idea to make acquaintances with people from your classes. Just in case you end up skipping a day. </p>
				</div>

				<div id="page3content1">
					<h3 class="header2"> Tip 3: Beer before liquor, never been sicker...</h3>
					<p class="paragraph"> Liquor before beer, you're in the clear!!!</p>

			<h2 class="title"> What Not To Do: </h2>
			<div id="page3content2">
				<h3 class="header2"> Tip 1: Don't nap 22 out of 24 hours a day </h3>
				<p class="paragraph"> Everyone loves sleeping as much as they love food. That's why naps start becoming an essential part to your daily routine. However, napping for an excessive amount of time will not lesson the stress brought to you by the demands of college life. Get into the habit of taking power naps. They are much more efficient. </p>
			</div>

				<div id="page3content3">
					<h3 class="header2"> Tip 2: Procrastination is NOT your best friend. </h3>
					<p class="paragraph"> We've been told this probably hundreds of times whether it be by our parents, teachers, or even ourselves. We still do it anyway, and everytime we tell ourselves that we're not going to do it again. It's a never-ending loop.</p>

				</div>

				<div id="page3content4">
					<h3 class="header2"> Tip 3: Food and Booze </h3>
					<p class="paragraph"> Don't spend money on things you don't necessarily need. You don't need to spend $60 a week on alcohol and partying; you can limit yourself to $30. The other $30 can go to other things you may need, such as groceries or late night munchies. </p>
